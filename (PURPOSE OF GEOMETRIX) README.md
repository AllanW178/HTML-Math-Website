GEOMETRIX - Website Project Explanation



- What is GEOMETRIX?
GEOMETRIX is a website I created to help people learn geometry in a way that's simple, calm, and
easy to follow. It lets users choose their level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and start learning
right away. I wanted the site to feel clean and modern - not like a messy worksheet.


- Why I Designed It This Way
I went for a sidebar layout so users can move between pages easily. The colors are soft blues and
whites to keep things calm and not stressful. The text is simple and clear, and everything works on
both computers and phones. Each page has a purpose and doesn't overload users with too much at
once.


- Advanced and Efficient Techniques I Used
- Advanced Techniques:
- I created custom HTML and CSS to build the layout and style from scratch.
- I used JavaScript to switch between level descriptions on the About page.
- Everything was built manually - no templates - so I could control the design.
- I'm planning to add a math rendering library like KaTeX to make the math look even better.

  
- Efficient Techniques:
- I used one main stylesheet to keep everything clean and easy to manage.
- Code comments are included to explain what's going on.
- I reused layout parts like navigation and structure across pages.
- The HTML and CSS pass W3C validation with no errors.
- Images and code are lightweight for quick loading.
- Feedback and What I Changed




I got feedback from my Lua Discord people who said things like:
- "It looks really tidy and clear."
- "Nice layout - not confusing."
- "It actually feels modern, not like some old school site."


Based on that, I updated the text to feel more natural, softened the color scheme, and kept the site
as simple as possible to avoid distractions.



- What I Learned
I learned how to make a multi-page website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also
learned how to make it mobile-friendly, how to explain my work better, and how to use feedback to
improve what I built.




- Final Thoughts

The project is still improving - I want to keep adding features that make learning easier. But
everything built so far shows advanced skills, good design choices, and real feedback. I'm proud of
how it turned out.
