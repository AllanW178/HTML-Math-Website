# GEOMETRIX - Website Project Explanation (HTML, CSS, JS & AOS LIBRARY)



### ▸ What is GEOMETRIX?

GEOMETRIX is a website I created to help people learn geometry in a way that's simple, calm, and easy to follow. It lets users choose their level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and start learning right away. I wanted the site to feel clean and modern – not like a messy worksheet.








### ▸ Why I Designed It This Way

I went for a sidebar layout so users can move between pages easily. The colors are soft blues and whites to keep things calm and not stressful. The text is simple and clear, and everything works on both computers and phones. Each page has a specific focus and avoids overwhelming users with too much information at once.








### ▸ Advanced and Efficient Techniques I Used

#### Advanced Techniques:
- I created custom HTML and CSS to build the layout and style fully.
- I used JavaScript for smooth switching between the level descriptions on the About page.
- I manually created each page instead of using templates to maintain full control over structure and design.
- I integrated **AOS.js (Animate On Scroll)** to create subtle, professional animations when scrolling — adding polish without distraction.
- I’m planning to include a math rendering library like **KaTeX** - where I brief learned on YouTube - to further improve how equations appear - it is not
  good as I expected but at least it does something. :)







#### Efficient Techniques:
- I kept one main stylesheet for shared styles to make everything consistent and easy to manage.
- I reused the navigation and page structure across all pages to reduce code duplication/repetition.
- The code is lightweight and loads quickly with small amount of external dependencies.
- HTML and CSS pass W3C validation with no errors.
- Code comments are added to improve clarity and maintainability.








### ▸ Feedback and What I Changed

I got feedback from my Lua Discord community who said things like:
- “It looks really tidy and clear.”
- “Nice layout – not confusing.”
- “It actually feels modern, not like some old school site.”
- (And so on...) - please check out 'Other people's feedback from my Lua Discord' if you haven't seen it.


Based on that, I:
- Updated the text to feel more natural and human.
- Softened the color scheme to reduce screen fatigue.
- Added scroll-triggered animations (AOS) to make transitions feel more fluid and purposeful.
- I focused on keeping the design minimal and no distractions to the users.






### ▸ What I Learned

- How to design and build a fully custom multi-page website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** from the ground up.
- How to add JavaScript-driven interactivity in a controlled and meaningful way.
- How to use animation libraries like **AOS.js** to elevate user experience without clutter.
- How to make a responsive website that works across devices.
- How to listen to feedback, reflect, and improve.

This project continues to grow — I plan to keep adding helpful features like better equation rendering and more lesson interactivity.
