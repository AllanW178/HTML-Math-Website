# GEOMETRIX Code Highlights and Why I Made These Changes

## Using a Class for the Body Tag



<body class="index">


- Why this didnâ€™t work well:
---
<body>
---
  
This didn't let me apply specific styles to different pages.

Why I changed it:
Adding a class like class="index" makes it easier to target styles for different pages (e.g., to highlight the home link in the navigation).

Why it's better:
It helps users feel oriented by making the navigation clearer.
