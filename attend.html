      <p class="main-title-1" data-aos="fade-right">Algebra</p>
      <p class="main-text-1" data-aos="fade-left">Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses mathematical statements to describe <br>
        relationships between things that vary. These variables include things like therelationship between the supply of an object and its price.<br>
        When we use a mathematical statement to describe a relationship, we often use letters to represent the quantity that varies, since it is not a <br> 
        fixed amount<br><br>

        To combine like terms, do the following:<br>
        1. Determine which terms contain the same variable or groups of variables raised to the same exponent.<br>
        2. Add or subtract the numerical coefficients.<br>
        3. Attach the common variables and exponents.<br>
        For example, 3x + 6x can be simplified to (3 + 6) x = 9x.<br><br><br>
      
      </p>

      <p class="main-title-1" data-aos="fade-right">The Importance of Algebra</p>
      <p class="main-text-1" data-aos="fade-left">Just as multiplying two by twelve is faster than counting to 24 or adding 2 <br>
        twelve times, algebra helps us solve problems more quickly and easily than we could otherwise. Learning algebra also opens <br>
        up whole new areas of life problems, such as graphing curves that cannot be solved with only foundational math skills.<br><br>

        Learning basic algebra is crucial not only for personal growth but also for professional development. It develops critical thinking skills, problem-solving <br>
        skills, and logical reasoning, which are essential skills for success in any field.<br><br>
